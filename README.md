# Delhivery Data Analysis  

## About Delhivery  
Delhivery is the largest and fastest-growing fully integrated logistics provider in India as of Fiscal 2021. The company aims to build the operating system for commerce through a blend of world-class infrastructure, high-quality logistics operations, and cutting-edge engineering and technology capabilities.  

The data team at Delhivery leverages vast datasets to enhance business intelligence, drive operational efficiency, and maintain profitability, creating a significant competitive edge.

## Objective  
The goal of this project is to process and analyze data generated by Delhivery's logistics operations to:  
1. **Clean, sanitize, and manipulate raw data** to derive actionable insights.  
2. **Create useful features** for the data science team to develop forecasting models.

## Dataset  
The dataset consists of records from Delhivery's logistics and operational data pipeline.  

### **Key Features**:  
- **`data`**: Indicates if the record is training or testing data.  
- **`trip_creation_time`**: Timestamp of trip creation.  
- **`route_schedule_uuid`**: Unique identifier for a route schedule.  
- **`route_type`**: Type of transportation (`FTL`, `Carting`).  
  - **FTL**: Full Truck Load shipments, faster delivery as there are no intermediate pickups/drop-offs.  
  - **Carting**: Delivery system using smaller vehicles (carts).  
- **`trip_uuid`**: Unique identifier for a trip (a trip can involve multiple source and destination centers).  
- **`source_center`**: ID of the trip's origin center.  
- **`source_name`**: Name of the trip's origin center.  
- **`destination_center`**: ID of the destination center.  
- **`destination_name`**: Name of the destination center.  
- **`od_start_time`**: Trip start time.  
- **`od_end_time`**: Trip end time.  
- **`start_scan_to_end_scan`**: Total time taken for delivery from source to destination.  
- **`actual_distance_to_destination`**: Actual distance in kilometers between source and destination.  
- **`actual_time`**: Cumulative time taken to complete the delivery.  
- **`osrm_time`**: Time calculated by the Open-Source Routing Machine (OSRM) considering shortest paths and typical traffic conditions (cumulative).  
- **`osrm_distance`**: Distance calculated by OSRM (cumulative).  
- **`segment_actual_time`**: Time taken for a segment of the delivery.  
- **`segment_osrm_time`**: OSRM-calculated time for a delivery segment.  
- **`segment_osrm_distance`**: OSRM-calculated distance for a delivery segment.  

### **Additional Fields**:  
Some fields with currently unclear meanings, like `is_cutoff`, `cutoff_factor`, `cutoff_timestamp`, and `factor`, are included for completeness and may be explored further.

## Process Overview  

### 1. **Feature Engineering**:  
- Derived meaningful metrics such as:  
  - **`time_diff_hours`**: Time difference between `od_start_time` and `od_end_time`.  
  - Extracted components from timestamps (e.g., month, year, day of the week).  
  - Split and standardized source and destination names into city, place code, and state.  

### 2. **Data Cleaning**:  
- Handled missing values using appropriate imputation techniques.  
- Addressed `outliers` with boxplots and the `IQR` method.  

### 3. **Categorical Feature Handling**:  
- Applied one-hot encoding to variables like `route_type` for better interpretability in downstream models.  

### 4. **Normalization and Standardization**:  
- Used MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler for numerical columns to align features to a uniform scale.

## Key Insights  

1. **Route Type Insights**:  
   - FTL routes are faster and more efficient for long distances compared to Carting.  

2. **Source and Destination Patterns**:  
   - High-frequency routes indicate key operational hubs that could benefit from resource optimization.  

3. **Time Efficiency**:  
   - Delivery times vary significantly by route type, season, and traffic conditions.  

4. **OSRM vs. Actual Metrics**:  
   - Discrepancies between OSRM-calculated and actual times/distances highlight areas for improving routing algorithms.

## Tools and Libraries  
This project utilized the following tools:  
- **Python**:  
  - `Pandas` for data manipulation.  
  - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for visualization.  
  - `Sklearn` for preprocessing and scaling.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis and documentation.

## Next Steps  
Future directions for this project include:  
1. Developing predictive models for delivery time and distance.  
2. Investigating patterns in the unknown fields (`is_cutoff`, `cutoff_factor`, etc.).  
3. Implementing clustering techniques to identify high-demand routes.
